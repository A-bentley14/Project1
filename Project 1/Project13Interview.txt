Cloud Security- Containers
When is it appropriate to use containers in cloud deployments, and what are the security benefits of doing so?
	In this project we used containers to setup both the webservers and the ELK server for the actual project. We used the containers to configure the webservers all the same and to configure the ELK Stack. Using the containers for the webservers was appropriate, because we wanted backup servers to add behind a load balancer and needed to set up multiple the exact same way. It allowed the VMs to all be configured in the exact same way and ensures that every machine is how it needs to be and ensures nothing was left out. Configuring VMs to run containers can be done by downloading docker and pulling the container you want . We used Docker Hub to find the correct container image to download. To configure the Webservers, we used ansible playbooks and sent the instructions to download docker and run the correct container for us. We verified that the containers were running on the webservers by connecting through ssh and using the "docker ps" comand to ensure it was running. Without containers, you would have to go to each machine individually to download and configure it all manually. An advantage to doing this without containers would be you could configure the machines differently if needed. Some disadvantages would be possible mistakes on a single machine causing the rest to not work in certain situations. Or the amount of time it would take to configure a large amount of machines.
